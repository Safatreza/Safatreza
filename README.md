## 🔧 About Me

I’m a detail-oriented **Computational Propulsion Engineer** focused on CFD-driven aerospace innovation, automation of engineering pipelines, and modern software development. My work integrates high-fidelity thermochemical simulation, CAD scripting, and backend tooling to accelerate the design of propulsion and test systems.

Currently advancing projects on **afterburner CFD**, **cryogenic fluid systems**, and **streamlined UI/UX tools** for aerospace engineers.
