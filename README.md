## 🔭 About Me

I'm currently in my 4th semester of Aerospace Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.  
At [Phantum](https://phantum.space), I've progressed through roles in aviation software, systems engineering, and now propulsion engineering — contributing to high-speed UAV development with a focus on automation, performance modeling, and system integration.

My academic and project work centers around building scientifically sound and technically practical aerospace solutions—from simulating supersonic nozzle flows to developing automated tools for UAV mission support.

## 🛠️ Personal Projects

- **💨 Supersonic Nozzle Calculator**  
  Python tool for calculating inlet/outlet parameters, Mach number, and thrust in supersonic nozzle design.  
  Focused on clean architecture and usability for engineers and students.

- **🚀 Jet Engine Thermodynamics**  
  Python-based simulation tool to model the thermodynamic cycle of a jet engine.  
  Calculates thrust, fuel flow, and thermal efficiency under varying operating conditions.

- **📈 Rocket Performance Calculator**  
  A simple, modular tool to estimate delta-v, burn time, and propellant requirements based on input parameters.  
  Useful for early-stage design evaluations and teaching purposes.
