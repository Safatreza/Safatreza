  <strong>My top four projects—cornerstones of my work on UAV propulsion, flight estimation, and nozzle design.</strong>
</div>

### ⚙️ Valkyrie Flight Estimator  
[🔗 github.com/Safatreza/valkyrie_flight_estimator](https://github.com/Safatreza/valkyrie_flight_estimator)  
A modular **Python** pipeline combining Kalman filters and sensor fusion to predict real-time state, guidance, and performance for the Valkyrie-1 UAV.  
- Integrates aerodynamic and propulsion data for Mach 0.6 test validation  
- Designed for plug-and-play with live telemetry feeds  

---

### 🛠️ Nozzle Design Tool  
[🔗 github.com/Safatreza/NozzleDesignTool](https://github.com/Safatreza/NozzleDesignTool)  
A **PyQt**-powered GUI application that computes and visualizes converging–diverging nozzle contours, thrust curves, and flow properties.  
- Interactive parameter sweeps for area ratio, expansion ratio, and inlet conditions  
- Exports geometry for CAD/CAM and CFD meshing  

---

### 🌪 Supersonic Nozzle Calculations  
[🔗 github.com/Safatreza/SupersonicNozzleCalculations](https://github.com/Safatreza/SupersonicNozzleCalculations)  
A lightweight **Python** library of functions to calculate area–Mach relations, pressure–temperature ratios, and thrust coefficients for supersonic nozzles.  
- Ideal for quick design iterations and back-of-envelope checks  
- Easily extendable for integration into larger CFD or optimization workflows  

---

### 🔥 afterburner-cfd  
[🔗 github.com/Safatreza/afterburner-cfd](https://github.com/Safatreza/afterburner-cfd)  
A CFD modeling framework in **Python** and **OpenFOAM** to simulate afterburner flow dynamics, temperature fields, and pressure distributions.  
- Includes baseline k–ε turbulence modeling  
- Work-in-progress validation against experimental datasets  

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- **Integrated UAV Mission Planner**: ML-based flight profile optimizer (Python, Flask, Scikit-learn)  
- **Swarm Autonomy**: ROS 2 multi-agent coordination with perception pipelines  
- **Advanced Nozzle & Combustion Research**: OpenFOAM workflows for next-gen propulsion
