## 🚀 About Me

I am a driven and detail-oriented Computational Propulsion Engineer with a passion for advancing rocket-ground support systems through high-fidelity CFD, custom tooling, and lean process automation. Currently pursuing advanced projects in afterburner thermo-CFD and fluid-system design, I apply software engineering best practices to streamline engineering workflows and deliver robust, production-ready solutions.

- 🎓 Pursuing BSc in Aerospace Engineering
- 🔬 Expertise in cryogenic fluid mechanics, two-phase flow, and thermo-chemical simulation
- 🛠️ Fluent in Python, OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, FastAPI, Streamlit, and CAD scripts
- 📈 Advocate for CI/CD, unit testing, and documentation-driven development
- 📫 Connect: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile) | ✉️ your.email@example.com
